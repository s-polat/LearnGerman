## What is a PWA?

A **Progressive Web App (PWA)** is a web application that offers an app-like experience on mobile and desktop. PWAs can be installed to your device's home screen, work offline, load fast, and provide native-like interactions such as push notifications and full-screen mode. This app is a PWA, so you can install it and use it just like a regular mobile or desktop application.
